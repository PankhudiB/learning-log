IP packet -> fundamental units -> made of bytes -> 

    2 main section:
    IP header and Data
    src | dest addresses | total size | version of internet protocol (v4 / v6)
    
    Data -> 2^16 -> 65000 bytes
    not enough 

    Tie the packets -> 

    TCP 
        is meant to send packets in particular order
        error free way (know if pkt is corrupted)
        guarentedly send

        will occupy some part of ip packet for tcp header 
        
    TCP is about sending arbitorary data

    HTTP build on top of TCP
        -> abstraction on top of TCP
        -> bought in request and response
        -> path
        -> methods - GET | POST | PUT
        ->
