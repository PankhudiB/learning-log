### ZeroMQ

#### Dec 18st 2022

#### About 

- messaging library -> [focus on library] -> that means -> its included in your application
- unlike rabbit mq - which is a server , 
- ZeroMQ is brokerless --> meh!
- you build what you need - rabbitmq/kafka -> is a bloat 

#### Messaging Patterns

- sync req/res
- async req/res
- supports pub/sub
- supports push/pull
- exclusive pair

#### Socket Types

- REQ --> only sends req
- REP -> reply
- PUSH
- PULL 
- DEALER -> its the client
- ROUTER -> is the server 

[in our case -> we need PUB/SUB -- since we want to broadcast]
