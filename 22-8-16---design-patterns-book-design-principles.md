## Reading Headfirst design pattern - noting down some principles 
#### Aug 16th 2022

I am re-reading Headfirst Design Pattern Book and thought of noting down things I liked


- ```Take what varies and “encapsulate” it so it won’t affect the rest of your code```

- ```HAS-A can be better than IS-A -----> Favor composition over inheritance```

- ```Program to interfaces, not implementations.```

- `Strategy` 
  - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
  - lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
