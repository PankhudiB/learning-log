      4. diff examples of concept
      5. Humor 
2. Packaging :
   1. Headline
   2. Images
      1. the speaker says - an image every 350 words - for human attention
      2. Pexels.com - for free images 
   3. Formatting
      1. use short paragraphs
      2. white spaces
      3. sub heads
      4. pull quotes
   4. Put conclusions - because ppl tend to skim through blog and then read the entire thing.
   5. Platform
      1. PLATFORM --- BUILT-IN AUDIENCE --- EASY TO USE --- BUILT IN SEO 
      2. medium   ---        Y                 ---  Y       ---  Y 
      3. wordpress ---        N                 ---  Y       ---  N  
        || own blog 
        || github pages
3. Publish
   1. tell your friends, colleagues to read it
   
4. Give credits and link other people's blogs
   1. this builds good network. mail them maybe - saying you referred them and u would be glad if the reposted/re-shared it
   2. it increases your credibility, people see you know other people.
   
5. For increasing engagement of your blog (comments or revisiting another blog of yours) - end your blog with a question ..something people can answer in comments.
