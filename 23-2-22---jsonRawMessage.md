In this blog, let us understand a unique problem of dynamic unmarshalling of `JSON` in golang. We will also look at where one might encounter it and how `json.RawMessage` helps us navigate it.

A common use-case for json unmarshalling is request/response parsing in HTTP. The client's deserialisation logic is straightforward since we have separate endpoints for separate json resources.

But in WebSocket world, we send and **receive** all sorts of different messages on the same WebSocket connection. And then the unique problem of intelligently deserialising these messages arises. You don't want to end up deserialising all the messages entirely every time !!! ü§Ø

That's messy! ü§¢

Let's say as a WebSocket server we want to send 2 types of messages:
```go
type MessageType_A struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Place string `json:"place"`
}

type MessageType_B struct {
    Animal string `json:"animal"`
    Thing  string `json:"thing"`
}
```

To send these messages we need to marshal these structs and write those bytes on the WebSocket connection.
The code will look something like this:
#### websocket_server_v1.go
```go
    messageA := MessageTypeA { Name:  "Pankhudi", Place: "India"}
    // OR
    messageB := MessageTypeB { Animal: "dog", Thing:  "cap"}
    
    bytes, err := json.Marshal(messageA) // OR messageB 
    err = websocketConn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, bytes)
```

Now, the WebSocket client's deserializing logic is not aware beforehand of what type of message it is going to receive.

**websocket_client_v1.go**
```go
    bytes, _, err := websocketConn.Read()
    if err != nil {...}
    
    messageA := MessageTypeA{}
    // OR
    messageB := MessageTypeB{}
    
    json.Unmarshal(dataBytes, &messageA)
    OR
    json.Unmarshal(dataBytes, &messageA)
    
```

Only if we knew which struct to initialize and unmarshal the bytes into. ü§î

##json.RawMessage to the rescue ! üòé

On the server, let's create a wrapper struct and introduce an additional attribute called `MessageType` and the actual message as something generic like `"content"`

**websocket_server_v2.go**
```go
    type MessageWrapper struct {
        MessageType   string `json:"message_type"`
        MessageType_A `json:"content"`
    }
```

Create an instance and populate it. Marshal it and write it on the WebSocket connection:

**websocket_server_v2.go**
```go
    messageA := MessageWrapper{ 
	            MessageType:   "A",
	            MessageType_A: MessageType_A{Name: "Pankhudi", Place: "India"}
                }
                
    bytes, err := json.Marshal(messageA)

    err = websocketConn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, bytes)
    if err != nil {...}
```

## And finally! Let us use `json.RawMessage` on the client side.

If you look inside the package it's essentially a type alias for byte array. Because that's the most basic form of representing data! Refer the library code: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/encoding/json/stream.go#L255

**websocket_client_v2.go**
```go
    type MessageWrapper struct {
        MessageType string          `json:"message_type"`
        Content     json.RawMessage `json:"content"`
    }
```

Now we can unmarshal the received bytes into the wrapper struct :
```go
    dataBytes, _, err := wsutil.ReadServerData(conn)
    if err != nil {...}

    messageWrapper := MessageWrapper{}
    err = json.Unmarshal(dataBytes, &messageWrapper)
    if err != nil {...}
```

By doing this, the unmarshaler populates only the `MessageType` field and ignores the rest. You don't believe me ? ü§®

##Let's have a look at the demo: üíª

WebSocket Server:
![websocket server starting](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwj1ou267a2qh9lz849e.png)

WebSocket Client:
![websocket client starting](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/74vmb27wrg0v42i8asmx.png)

WebSocket Server receives the below request from client and responds with the message:

![server sent back the message of type A](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/azbpdkj4ujrwbvv38xp5.png)

On the client end, post unmarshalling - you get to see the message type but the actual content is still in `[]byte` and raw !

![type printed, but content is still printed as byte representation](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wgphztxg3lwvxkbnyn42.png)

And you can happily defer unmarshalling the rest of the message based on message type! ü§ó

## So, In a nutshell when to use json.RawMessage?

1. To ignore certain parts of the JSON payload
    - Why would one even need that? - you ask.
      Well let's say in the above WebSocket connection, the server needed to send Keep-Alive packets.
      In that case knowing only the message type should serve the purpose.

2. To take explicit control of unmarshalling the data and thus defer that until you've branched out based on some condition
    - We saw in the above use-case.
