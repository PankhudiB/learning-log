# SAGAs

My Gist : 

--> done for Distributed Transactions

--> If our use case required `data consistency across several microservices`, and `required rollback when one of the step is failed`, than we should use Saga pattern.

## Choreography :

the co-ordination is achieved using pub-sub -->

`With choreography, each microservices run its own local transaction`

`and publishes events to message broker system`

`and that trigger local transactions in other microservices.`

## Orchestration : 

there is a central service that takes responsibility of orchestrating the event cycle

- Good -> for complex workflows which includes lots of steps.
- But this makes single point-of-failure
