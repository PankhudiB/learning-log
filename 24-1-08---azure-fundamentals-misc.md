## Azure Fundamentals

### Economies of scale - the more you buy, the less you pay per unit

Small company vs Large company
- small company pays more per unit than large company
- operational cost is higher for small no of products

---------------------------

### CapEx vs OpEx

#### CapEx
Capital Expenditure
On Premise
Big initial investment
Lots of maintenance
- support staff
- power and net
- hardware failure
server capacity does not match demand
Early termination - Not possible


#### OpEx 
Rent Infrastructure
No initial investment
PAY WHAT YOU USE
minimal maintenance - managed by cloud provider / vendor
Early termination - possible

---------------------------

### Consumption Based Model

- Pay for what you use

- Compute
- Storage 
- Network

---------------------------

### IaaS PaaS SaaS

[Application / Data]                    | = Software (SaaS) eg - Outlook, Office 365

=========

[Runtime - Docker , IIS ]               |
[Middleware - Softwares]                | = Platform (PaaS)
[Operating System -Windows , Linus]     |

=========                    
                                       
[Visturalization]						|
[Server - Memory, motherboard,CPU]		| -- Infrastructure (IaaS)	
[Networking - routers, switches]		|
[Storage, Hardware - HDD, SSD]			|
         

VM is an example of IaaS
SQL Server installed on VM is an example of IaaS - If you install in manually - Its still a VM
Azure SQL Database is an example of PaaS - You dont need to maintain it 

--------------------------------

### Public Cloud vs Private Cloud vs Hybrid Cloud

#### Public Cloud
- Owned by cloud provider
- Hardware shared by multiple customers      
- No local hardware
