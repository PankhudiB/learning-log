gRPC can be just thought of as client library code 

-- so that u don't have to worry about the programming language's client library code maintainance

-- it also abstracts if it switched version of HTTP.. and switch is smooth for us. - this is both good and bad :/

-- Compared to REST --> gRPC is better performing but less flexibility :|

-- It is faster than REST - bcoz of the tight packing of Protocol Buffers

-- How exactly is gRPC fast ? -- need to check
