Today when I was experimenting something on a jump host - I needed certain files to be present on the jump host [Jump host was a remote server]

    SCP

* secure copy
  * From your local system to a remote system.
  * From a remote system to your local system.
  * Between two remote systems from your local system.
* relies on ssh for data transfer
* Must have at least : 
  * read permissions on the source file 
  * write permission on the target system.
